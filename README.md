# Balancing Robot with LEGO EV3 and Pybricks
## What This Project Does

This project controls a LEGO EV3 robot that balances on two wheels. The robot uses a gyroscope to stay upright. You can change how it balances by adjusting a setting (Kp) using buttons on the EV3.

## What You Can Do

- Keep the robot balanced using the gyroscope.

- Use EV3 buttons to change the Kp value:

    - UP: Increase Kp

    - DOWN: Decrease Kp

    - CENTER: Reset the gyroscope

## What You Need

- LEGO EV3 Brick with Pybricks firmware

- 2 Large Motors (Ports C and D)

- EV3 Gyroscope Sensor (Port S2)

## How to Use

Run the program on the EV3. Use the buttons to adjust Kp until the robot balances well.
